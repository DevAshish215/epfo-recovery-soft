# Modules Directory

This directory will contain business logic modules in future phases.

## Planned Structure

```
modules/
├── auth/           # Authentication module (future)
├── establishments/ # EPFO establishment management (future)
├── notices/        # Notice generation (future)
└── officers/       # Enforcement officer management (future)
```

Each module will have its own:
- Routes
- Controllers
- Models
- Services
- Validators

This keeps the codebase organized and maintainable.
